          <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li>
              provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User
              and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
              subject;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
              exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
              Owner or by a third party.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies
            to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a
            statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a
            contract.
          </p>

          <h3>Further information about retention time</h3>

          <p>
            Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored
            for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained
            for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between
              the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be
              retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific
              information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the
              relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User
            has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn.
            Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period
            whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
            of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data
            portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
          </p>

          <h3>The rights of Users based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>

            <li>
              <strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to object to

            <li>
              <strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the

              <strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to

            <li>

            the Owner to safeguard their Data.
          </p>

          <h4>Details about the right to object to processing</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official
              authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
              by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to
              their particular situation to justify the objection.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct
              marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and
              without providing any justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct
              marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes.
